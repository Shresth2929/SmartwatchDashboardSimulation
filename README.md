# 🧠 Smartwatch Dashboard Simulator

An interactive simulation of a smartwatch dashboard that replicates real-time fitness tracking using animated charts, system logs, and sensor control. It includes **mock integration with Google Fit** and a **dynamic battery level system** that mimics a real-world smartwatch experience.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To create a **web-based smartwatch simulation interface** that:
- Animates health metrics in real-time
- Allows users to toggle sensors like a smartwatch would
- Demonstrates API integration (Google Fit)
- Simulates system events such as battery drainage and warnings
- Maintains a clean and responsive UI

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** + **CSS3** (Tailwind CSS)
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **Chart.js** – for data visualizations
- **Font Awesome** – for UI icons
- **Google Fit API (mocked or integrated)**

---

## 🔧 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔄 **Real-time Chart Animation** | Smooth, auto-updating line charts for Heart Rate, Step Count, and Temperature |
| 🎛️ **Sensor Toggles** | Enable or disable individual sensors (like in real wearables) |
| 🔋 **Battery Simulator** | Battery drains over time with alerts at 20%, 10%, 5%, and 0% |
| ⌚ **Control Panel** | `Start`, `Stop`, `Reset`, `Sync with Fit`, `Fetch` Google Fit data |
| 📜 **System Logs** | Timestamped logs of all major actions and sensor events |
| ☁️ **Google Fit API (Mock)** | Simulates fetching of today's step data |
